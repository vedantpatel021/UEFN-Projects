## TNT Tag
### [Creative Map Page](https://www.fortnite.com/@vedant/5112-4348-4975?lang=en-US)
A fast-paced twist on the classic game of tag, where guns are your tagging tool. In TNT Tag, players shoot to tag each other, passing on the "it" status. The goal? Avoid being the tagger when the timer runs out. Players who are "it" at the end of the round are eliminated and enter spectator mode, while the remaining players continue. This cycle repeats until only one player is left standing to claim victory!

## Push The Point
### [Development in progress...]
In this intense, team-based strategy game, two teams battle to control the battlefield across three lanes. Push The Point challenges teams to capture control points in each lane. Once a team captures all the points in a lanes, it comes down to the battle between two lanes, and those lanes become a warfare, pushing the action to see who can claim one of the two final lane. Success relies on teamwork, strategy, and quick decision-making as teams strive to dominate the arena.
