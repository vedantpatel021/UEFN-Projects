# TNT Tag
### [Creative Map Page](https://www.fortnite.com/@vedant/5112-4348-4975?lang=en-US)
A fast-paced twist on the classic game of tag, where guns are your tagging tool. In TNT Tag, players shoot to tag each other, passing on the "it" status. The goal? Avoid being the tagger when the timer runs out. Players who are "it" at the end of the round are eliminated and enter spectator mode, while the remaining players continue. This cycle repeats until only one player is left standing to claim victory!

### Features
Voting System:
- Overview:
    - At the start of the game, all players can vote for the weapon they want the taggers to play with
- Logistics:
    - Using **analytics device** to calculate player trends and behaviors for which weapon selections are liked by players
    - Utilizing data from analytics to plan for future changes to weapon selection

 - _**image of the pie chart of weapon selection in analytics page**_

Tagging Mechanism:
- Overview:
    - Tagger has an explosive bomb as a head and posesses a weapon
    - Tagging someone else removes them as a tagger and changes them to a runner
- Logistics:
    - Accomplished by **dynamically detecting damage** recipient and instigator for changing player **classes & teams**
    - Utilized **niagara effects** for attaching the bomb to the head

- _**gif of a tagger tagging someone else and then getting tagged back**_

Custom Game Rounds:
- Overview:
    - Created our own "quick-reset" round system instead of using the slow build-in round ending system
    - Pros of our system over build-in feature:
        - Gameplay doesn't stop after tagger timer runs out
        - New taggers are assigned instantly
        - Avoids hard reseting of the island states
    - Cons of our system over build-in feature:
        - NONE :)
- Logistics:
    - filler

## Push The Point
### [Development in progress...]
In this intense, team-based strategy game, two teams battle to control the battlefield across three lanes. Push The Point challenges teams to capture control points in each lane. Once a team captures all the points in a lanes, it comes down to the battle between two lanes, and those lanes become a warfare, pushing the action to see who can claim one of the two final lane. Success relies on teamwork, strategy, and quick decision-making as teams strive to dominate the arena.
